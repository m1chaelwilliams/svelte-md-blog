I started my YouTube channel for 2 reasons:
 1. Teach people
 2. Hold myself accountable

# 1. Teach People

I've always enjoyed teaching people things. As a teenager, I would go to my local skatepark and help out new skaters with tricks they were trying to learn. It brings me more joy to assist others than to focus on myself only.

# 2. Hold Myself Accountable

I have a hard time staying focused on a personal project. There's no reason why I can't just drop a project when I get bored; so I do... a lot. Making a channel revolving around coding has forced me to stick with projects to the end.
